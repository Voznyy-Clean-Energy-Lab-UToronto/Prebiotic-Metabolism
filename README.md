# Prebiotic Metabolism

# To-do
- [ ] Do research and pick on a temperature to do calculations (base on hydrothermal vents, if doing that).

## xTB
Do all calculations (except Geom opt and MD) in triplicates to add variability measurement.

- **Initial Calculations (No metal centers)**
  - Optimize structures using Geometric Optimization:
    - [ ] Pyruvate + CO2
    - [ ] PEP + CO2
    - [ ] Oxaloacetate
    - [ ] Oxaloacetate + PO3^{2-}
          
  - Total Energy calculation comparison for initial and final compounds.
    - Calculate:  
      - [ ] GFN1
        - [ ] Pyruvate + CO2
        - [ ] PEP + CO2
        - [ ] Oxaloacetate
        - [ ] Oxaloacetate + PO3^{2-}
              
      - [ ] GFN2
        - [ ] Pyruvate + CO2
        - [ ] PEP + CO2
        - [ ] Oxaloacetate
        - [ ] Oxaloacetate + PO3^{2-}
              
  - Molecular Dynamics
    - [ ] Pyruvic acid + Base (yet to decide on base)
    - [ ] Pyruvate + CO2 (testing for formation of Oxaloacetate)
    - [ ] PEP + CO2 (testing for formation of Oxaloacetate)
    
- **Calculations with 1 metal center (as an aqua (H2O) complex)**. For this one, need to do some research into the coordinate numbers of the metal centers, as well as their most stable oxidation states in water?
